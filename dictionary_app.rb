# Build a terminal dictionary app
# Create a new ruby file called dictionary_app.rb
# The program should ask the user to enter a word, then use the wordnik API to show the wordâ€™s definition: https://developer.wordnik.com/docs#!/word/getDefinitions
# Once that works, have it also display the top example and pronunciation (browse through the documentation to the top example and pronunciation).
# Bonus: Write your program in a loop such that the user can keep entering new words without having to restart the program. Give them the option of entering q to quit.
